## Reading order (recommended)

1. `00_INDEX.md` (this file)
2. `0k_PRD.md` — what we're building + why
3. `01_ARCHITECTURE.md` — how it fits together
4. `03_MODULES.md` — what each module owns
5. `04_TESTING.md` — Definition of Done gates
6. `05_DEPLOYMENT.md` — how we ship + rollback
7. `0l_DECISIONS.md` — why we made key calls

## Rules of the road

- **One source of truth:** if two docs say different things → raise a FLAG and resolve.
- **Keep docs runnable:** prefer concrete paths, commands, and acceptance criteria over prose.
- **When adding capabilities:** update `03_MODULES.md` + the owning module's README/AGENTS.

## Agent Teams — Sprint Execution Process

For projects using Claude Code Agent Teams to execute sprints:

| Resource | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Sprint Team Launch Skill | `.claude/skills/sprint-team-launch.md` | Reusable skill loaded by team leads — covers creation, task board, coordination, shutdown |
| Team Playbook Template | `docs/templates/sprints/sprint_XX_team_playbook_TEMPLATE.md` | Copy-paste TaskCreate prompts for FOUNDER to launch team |
| Lessons Learned Template | `docs/templates/AGENT_TEAMS_LESSONS_TEMPLATE.md` | Cumulative registry — add findings after every sprint |

**End-to-end process:**
1. CPTO writes sprint spec + kickoff (tasks, acceptance criteria)
2. CPTO writes team playbook (verbatim TaskCreate blocks per teammate)
3. FOUNDER opens dedicated CLI, creates team, pastes TaskCreate blocks
4. Team lead coordinates — unblocks dependencies, reviews deliverables
5. FOUNDER intervenes only for auth/config/decisions that need human access
6. Team lead produces sprint report, shuts down teammates
7. CPTO runs GBU review on deliverables, logs lessons learned
8. FOUNDER approves gate → next sub-sprint

**Worked examples:** See `agents/project_management/sprints/sprint_11/todo/` for real playbooks (11a, 11b).
